## Inline Fold - VSCode Extension
> ⚠️ NOTICE: this extension is still under active development! ⚠️

## VS Code Inline Fold Extension

VS Code Inline Fold extension mimics VS Code's [folding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_folding) experience for inline code.
This is especially useful when working with frameworks like Tailwind CSS which use lots of utility classes that often disfigure code visual structure. You can expand the folds by clicking on them. You can also configure the extension to target specific attributes in your markup.
The characters used as a mask can be configured in the settings and you can update the regex expression to match any code pattern you want.
The extension also enables folding of attribute values within HTML/JSX tags. It makes your code tidy and easier to navigate.

### SVG As For Another USE Case
Embeded SVG also tend to have alot of code, that you just dont wanna focus on.
So with this settings below you can fold the ugly part.
```
Regex to Match: <svg(\s*.*?\s*)<\/svg>
Regex Flags: gs
``` 
**Note**: Minfing SVG maybe required for better experience.Beside we looking forward that this extension will support multiple Regex soon.
